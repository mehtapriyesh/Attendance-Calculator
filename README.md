# Attendance-Calculator
The ultimate program to extract all your MS Teams CSV files from one folder and bring out the clean attendance sheet from it.

DO NOT FORGET TO README

This program is my self initative in order to save the organizations and meeting hosts to get a good idea of how interactive their webinar was.

Steps to keep in mind:
#Do not edit the downloaded csv file at all.
1) Add all your csv files to one empty folder or in case you have just one file you can add its path extension to the variable files.
2) You are supposed to list the names of meeting hosts as appears in the csv files. (Note: Ensure that there is only one name from this list in each of the files. 
(ex: Two organisers in one meeting would lead to program not working properly as we are calculating the duration using the joining time of organiser whose name appears first in the file.)
3) Add the duration of meeting in hours.
4) Ensure that your teams file uses same time format as in the code
5) In case this program helps you, it would be great if you could give me credits.

Thanks.
